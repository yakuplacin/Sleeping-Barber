You just need to type to the terminal "make"

After make, you should type the examples. Here, you didn't give the number of chairs, you forgot to give. 
So, I also implement it to the code. You should type 1 more value when you execute. Here there is an example that you should type after write "make":

"./barber 25 500 100 10 15"   //the last value should be implemented, you didn't give that one in the HomeWork!
